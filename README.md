# React Application Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run a React application created with create-react-app. 

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system.

## Application Details

- TypeScript
- Axios for backend connections
- Tailwind CSS and Ant Design for styling
- Session storage for token storage

## Setup Instructions

1. Verify that the configuration in the `.env.local` file matches the backend server's URL.

2. Install the dependencies by running the following command:

```
npm install
```

3. Start the application in development mode by running the following command:

```
npm start
```

4. Once the application is compiled and the development server is running, you can access it by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Important Note

In the file `src/components/forms/DianosisForm.tsx`, there is a small disclaimer with design justifications. Please refer to that file for more information.
